## üåü Projects
### Multimodal Emotion Recognition with Deep Learning
Developed a multimodal emotion recognition system that fuses text embeddings from fine-tuned BERT with audio features extracted using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). By constructing preprocessing workflows for both modalities and training multilayer perceptron classifiers, the approach demonstrated that integrating text and audio provides richer emotional context than unimodal baselines. The results highlight the potential of multimodal AI to improve applications such as customer support, mental health monitoring, and human-computer interaction.

### Spotify Music Genre Classification with Machine Learning
This project built a machine learning pipeline to classify Spotify songs into genres using a combination of preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and ensemble modeling. PCA and KMeans revealed meaningful structure in the audio features, while a tuned Random Forest classifier delivered strong predictive performance and generalization across genres. Feature importance analysis identified popularity, loudness, and instrumentalness as the most influential predictors, providing both accuracy and interpretability. The project demonstrated how audio attributes can effectively capture genre distinctions and support multi-class classification at scale.

### Home Credit Default Risk ADS Audit
Audited a credit scoring system built on 300,000+ loan applications to assess accuracy, fairness, and interpretability. While feature engineering and LightGBM models delivered strong performance, subgroup analysis revealed fairness concerns for older applicants. The audit recommended fairness-aware modeling, SHAP explanations, and continuous monitoring to ensure responsible deployment in lending.

### Immigration and Labor Market: Mariel Boatlift Analysis
This project reviewed David Card's classic study on the 1980 Mariel Boatlift, where a sudden influx of Cuban immigrants increased Miami's labor force by about 7%. Using a Difference-in-Differences framework with comparable U.S. cities, the study estimated the causal effect of immigration on wages and unemployment, particularly for low-skilled and minority workers. The analysis found no significant negative impacts, showing that Miami‚Äôs labor market absorbed the new workers effectively. The review highlighted the study‚Äôs influential role in immigration policy debates, its strong causal design, and limitations in statistical inference that invite further research.

### Spotify Music Popularity Analysis & Predictive Modeling
Examined Spotify audio features to predict and explain song popularity. The dataset was cleaned, standardized with z-score normalization, and reduced with PCA to uncover structure. Statistical tests (Mann-Whitney U), correlation analysis, and regression models identified significant differences across song attributes and revealed instrumentalness as the strongest predictor of popularity, with multiple regression improving accuracy. Logistic regression and classification trees were also applied for predicting mode and genre.

### Time Series Modeling with Applications in Economics
Applied advanced time-series methods, ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) and ETS (Exponential Smoothing), to forecast U.S. stock indices (S&P500, NASDAQ, and DJIA). Using two decades of historical data, our team performed preprocessing steps such as logarithmic transformations and differencing to achieve stationarity, then compared the predictive accuracy of ARIMA and ETS under conditions of market volatility. The analysis highlighted ARIMA's relative strength in capturing volatility and long-term patterns. Then culminated in a group presentation, technical report, and a peer-reviewed individual publication paper at EMFRM 2023, offering insights valuable to investors, researchers, and policymakers for understanding stock market behavior and improving forecasting strategies.

### Singapore Economy Analysis
This project analyzed Singapore's economic development from 2001 to 2020 using indicators such as GDP, FDI, employment, and consumer prices. Data was processed and visualized in Excel to generate graphs showing growth patterns and the impacts of events like the 2008 financial crisis and COVID-19. The study highlighted Singapore's resilience, policy-driven growth, and transformation into a global financial hub, while noting volatility and sustainability challenges.

### SWS Healthcare Stock Pitch ‚Äì Reata Pharmaceuticals
Evaluated Reata Pharmaceuticals as an investment opportunity using SWOT, PESTLE, and Porter's Five Forces analyses, supported by revenue forecasting and peer benchmarking. The research incorporated clinical trial outcomes, FDA approvals, and industry growth drivers to assess the company's pipeline and strategic position. A discounted cash flow model and valuation multiples reinforced the investment thesis, which projected over 100% upside potential.
